## [Project 1:Predicting Water Permeability Constant]()
Applied neural network model with tensorflow on the dataset by research paper titled “Neural network based correlation for estimating water permeability constant in RO desalination process under fouling” with R2 score of 0.96 
& deployed at Heroku

 
## [Project 2:Drug Classifier](https://github.com/imshivam24/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Drug%20Classifier)

* I used decision tree classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications.Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

* Job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and #Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

### About the dataset
* Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.


## [Project 3: Cancer Detection](https://github.com/imshivam24/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Cancer%20Detection)

* In this notebook, i used SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

* SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.

### About the dataset
* The example is based on a dataset that is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007)[http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html]. The dataset consists of several hundred human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics. The fields in each record are:

## [Project 4:Content Based Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/imshivam24/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Content%20Based%20Movie%20Recommendation)

* Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous, and can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In this notebook, we will explore Content-based recommendation systems and implement a simple version of one using Python and the Pandas library.

## [Project 5:Digit Recognizer by Random Forest](https://github.com/imshivam24/Machine_Learning/tree/master/MNIST%20Data%20Classifier%20by%20Random%20Forest)

### About the dataset
* MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this notebook, i tried to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images with score of 0.94 in kaggle .

## [Project 1:Drug Classifier](https://github.com/imshivam24/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Drug%20Classifier)

* I used decision tree classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications.Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

* Job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and #Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

### About the dataset
* Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.


## [Project 2: Cancer Detection](https://github.com/imshivam24/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Cancer%20Detection)

* In this notebook, i used SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

* SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.

### About the dataset
* The example is based on a dataset that is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007)[http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html]. The dataset consists of several hundred human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics. The fields in each record are:

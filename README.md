## [Project 1:Drug Classifier](https://github.com/imshivam24/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Drug%20Classifier)

* I used decision tree classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications.Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

### About the dataset
* Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.

* Job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and #Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
